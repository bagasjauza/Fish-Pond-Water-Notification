# Fish-Pond-Water-Notification
You dont need a ruler to measure the water level.
The fish pond in my house has inspired me to make this project. Everytime I fill the pond with a water, I dont have to worry about the water level. 
This system is based on Arduino. I use LCD, relay and ultrasonic sensor. Unit used to measure the height of the water using CM.
If the distance between the water and the sensor is getting closer, the water level will be higher. The relay is to turn on the water pump. 
If the water distance to the sensor is less than equal to 20cm, the LCD displays water in the pond is enough and the relay is turn off.
If the distance between the water and the sensor is more than equal to 60, the LCD displays in the pond is not enough and the relay is turn on.
